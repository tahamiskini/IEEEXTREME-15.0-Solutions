# IEEEXTREME-15.0-Solutions
Solutions to some of the IEEEXtreme problems.
IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members – 
advised and proctored by an IEEE member, and often supported by an IEEE Student Branch – 
compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems.
